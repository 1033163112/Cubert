Other I/O Operators
=======================

TEE
-------

TEE operator is useful for storing the results of a computation during intermediate stages to a specified output location. Unlike STORE, this operator can be used anywhere in the script. In addition to input relation, this operator can take a predicate and store only the tuples that match the predicate. Just like unix tee pipes, this operator outputs the data to HDFS and also sends the (unmodified and complete) input data the next operator.

**Note that the TEE operator can only store data in AVRO format**.

Examples of using this operator are as follows.

.. code-block:: java

	// Store all the input data in a folder::
	output = TEE data INTO "$teeOutputPath" USING AVRO;

	// Store only the tuples which have member_sk > 100 into the output folder::
	output = TEE data INTO "$teeOutputPath" USING AVRO IF member_sk > 100;


LOAD-CACHED
---------------

This operator is used to load a single file from the distributed cache. The usage of this operator is as follows:

.. code-block:: java
	
	// The path must refer to a single file, not a directory or multiple files through "*"
	pagekey = LOAD-CACHED "$input/pagekey.avro" USING AVRO;
