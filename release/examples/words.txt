jeeves
i
said
may
i
speak
frankly
certainly
sir
what
i
have
to
say
may
wound
you
not
at
all
sir
well
then
nowait
hold
the
line
a
minute
ive
gone
off
the
rails
i
dont
know
if
you
have
had
the
same
experience
but
the
snag
i
always
come
up
against
when
im
telling
a
story
is
this
dashed
difficult
problem
of
where
to
begin
it
its
a
thing
you
dont
want
to
go
wrong
over
because
one
false
step
and
youre
sunk
i
mean
if
you
fool
about
too
long
at
the
start
trying
to
establish
atmosphere
as
they
call
it
and
all
that
sort
of
rot
you
fail
to
grip
and
the
customers
walk
out
on
you
get
off
the
mark
on
the
other
hand
like
a
scalded
cat
and
your
public
is
at
a
loss
it
simply
raises
its
eyebrows
and
cant
make
out
what
youre
talking
about
and
in
opening
my
report
of
the
complex
case
of
gussie
finknottle
madeline
bassett
my
cousin
angela
my
aunt
dahlia
my
uncle
thomas
young
tuppy
glossop
and
the
cook
anatole
with
the
above
spot
of
dialogue
i
see
that
i
have
made
the
second
of
these
two
floaters
i
shall
have
to
hark
back
a
bit
and
taking
it
for
all
in
all
and
weighing
this
against
that
i
suppose
the
affair
may
be
said
to
have
had
its
inception
if
inception
is
the
word
i
want
with
that
visit
of
mine
to
cannes
if
i
hadnt
gone
to
cannes
i
shouldnt
have
met
the
bassett
or
bought
that
white
mess
jacket
and
angela
wouldnt
have
met
her
shark
and
aunt
dahlia
wouldnt
have
played
baccarat
yes
most
decidedly
cannes
was
the
point
dappui
right
ho
then
let
me
marshal
my
facts
i
went
to
cannesleaving
jeeves
behind
he
having
intimated
that
he
did
not
wish
to
miss
ascotround
about
the
beginning
of
june
with
me
travelled
my
aunt
dahlia
and
her
daughter
angela
tuppy
glossop
angelas
betrothed
was
to
have
been
of
the
party
but
at
the
last
moment
couldnt
get
away
uncle
tom
aunt
dahlias
husband
remained
at
home
because
he
cant
stick
the
south
of
france
at
any
price
so
there
you
have
the
layoutaunt
dahlia
cousin
angela
and
self
off
to
cannes
round
about
the
beginning
of
june
all
pretty
clear
so
far
what
we
stayed
at
cannes
about
two
months
and
except
for
the
fact
that
aunt
dahlia
lost
her
shirt
at
baccarat
and
angela
nearly
got
inhaled
by
a
shark
while
aquaplaning
a
pleasant
time
was
had
by
all
on
july
the
twentyfifth
looking
bronzed
and
fit
i
accompanied
aunt
and
child
back
to
london
at
seven
pm
on
july
the
twentysixth
we
alighted
at
victoria
and
at
seventwenty
or
thereabouts
we
parted
with
mutual
expressions
of
esteemthey
to
shove
off
in
aunt
dahlias
car
to
brinkley
court
her
place
in
worcestershire
where
they
were
expecting
to
entertain
tuppy
in
a
day
or
two
i
to
go
to
the
flat
drop
my
luggage
clean
up
a
bit
and
put
on
the
soup
and
fish
preparatory
to
pushing
round
to
the
drones
for
a
bite
of
dinner
and
it
was
while
i
was
at
the
flat
towelling
the
torso
after
a
muchneeded
rinse
that
jeeves
as
we
chatted
of
this
and
thatpicking
up
the
threads
as
it
weresuddenly
brought
the
name
of
gussie
finknottle
into
the
conversation
as
i
recall
it
the
dialogue
ran
something
as
follows
self
well
jeeves
here
we
are
what
jeeves
yes
sir
self
i
mean
to
say
home
again
jeeves
precisely
sir
self
seems
ages
since
i
went
away
jeeves
yes
sir
self
have
a
good
time
at
ascot
jeeves
most
agreeable
sir
self
win
anything
jeeves
quite
a
satisfactory
sum
thank
you
sir
self
good
well
jeeves
what
news
on
the
rialto
anybody
been
phoning
or
calling
or
anything
during
my
abs
jeeves
mr
finknottle
sir
has
been
a
frequent
caller
i
stared
indeed
it
would
not
be
too
much
to
say
that
i
gaped
mr
finknottle
yes
sir
you
dont
mean
mr
finknottle
yes
sir
but
mr
finknottles
not
in
london
yes
sir
well
im
blowed
and
ill
tell
you
why
i
was
blowed
i
found
it
scarcely
possible
to
give
credence
to
his
statement
this
finknottle
you
see
was
one
of
those
freaks
you
come
across
from
time
to
time
during
lifes
journey
who
cant
stand
london
he
lived
year
in
and
year
out
covered
with
moss
in
a
remote
village
down
in
lincolnshire
never
coming
up
even
for
the
eton
and
harrow
match
and
when
i
asked
him
once
if
he
didnt
find
the
time
hang
a
bit
heavy
on
his
hands
he
said
no
because
he
had
a
pond
in
his
garden
and
studied
the
habits
of
newts
i
couldnt
imagine
what
could
have
brought
the
chap
up
to
the
great
city
i
would
have
been
prepared
to
bet
that
as
long
as
the
supply
of
newts
didnt
give
out
nothing
could
have
shifted
him
from
that
village
of
his
are
you
sure
yes
sir
you
got
the
name
correctly
finknottle
yes
sir
well
its
the
most
extraordinary
thing
it
must
be
five
years
since
he
was
in
london
he
makes
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
the
place
gives
him
the
pip
until
now
he
has
always
stayed
glued
to
the
country
completely
surrounded
by
newts
sir
newts
jeeves
mr
finknottle
has
a
strong
newt
complex
you
must
have
heard
of
newts
those
little
sort
of
lizard
things
that
charge
about
in
ponds
oh
yes
sir
the
aquatic
members
of
the
family
salamandridae
which
constitute
the
genus
molge
thats
right
well
gussie
has
always
been
a
slave
to
them
he
used
to
keep
them
at
school
i
believe
young
gentlemen
frequently
do
sir
he
kept
them
in
his
study
in
a
kind
of
glasstank
arrangement
and
pretty
niffy
the
whole
thing
was
i
recall
i
suppose
one
ought
to
have
been
able
to
see
what
the
end
would
be
even
then
but
you
know
what
boys
are
careless
heedless
busy
about
our
own
affairs
we
scarcely
gave
this
kink
in
gussies
character
a
thought
we
may
have
exchanged
an
occasional
remark
about
it
taking
all
sorts
to
make
a
world
but
nothing
more
you
can
guess
the
sequel
the
trouble
spread
indeed
sir
absolutely
jeeves
the
craving
grew
upon
him
the
newts
got
him
arrived
at
mans
estate
he
retired
to
the
depths
of
the
country
and
gave
his
life
up
to
these
dumb
chums
i
suppose
he
used
to
tell
himself
that
he
could
take
them
or
leave
them
alone
and
then
foundtoo
latethat
he
couldnt
it
is
often
the
way
sir
too
true
jeeves
at
any
rate
for
the
last
five
years
he
has
been
living
at
this
place
of
his
down
in
lincolnshire
as
confirmed
a
speciesshunning
hermit
as
ever
put
fresh
water
in
the
tank
every
second
day
and
refused
to
see
a
soul
thats
why
i
was
so
amazed
when
you
told
me
he
had
suddenly
risen
to
the
surface
like
this
i
still
cant
believe
it
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
must
be
some
mistake
and
that
this
bird
who
has
been
calling
here
is
some
different
variety
of
finknottle
the
chap
i
know
wears
hornrimmed
spectacles
and
has
a
face
like
a
fish
how
does
that
check
up
with
your
data
the
gentleman
who
came
to
the
flat
wore
hornrimmed
spectacles
sir
and
looked
like
something
on
a
slab
possibly
there
was
a
certain
suggestion
of
the
piscine
sir
then
it
must
be
gussie
i
suppose
but
what
on
earth
can
have
brought
him
up
to
london
i
am
in
a
position
to
explain
that
sir
mr
finknottle
confided
to
me
his
motive
in
visiting
the
metropolis
he
came
because
the
young
lady
is
here
young
lady
yes
sir
you
dont
mean
hes
in
love
yes
sir
well
im
dashed
im
really
dashed
i
positively
am
dashed
jeeves
and
i
was
too
i
mean
to
say
a
jokes
a
joke
but
there
are
limits
then
i
found
my
mind
turning
to
another
aspect
of
this
rummy
affair
conceding
the
fact
that
gussie
finknottle
against
all
the
ruling
of
the
form
book
might
have
fallen
in
love
why
should
he
have
been
haunting
my
flat
like
this
no
doubt
the
occasion
was
one
of
those
when
a
fellow
needs
a
friend
but
i
couldnt
see
what
had
made
him
pick
on
me
it
wasnt
as
if
he
and
i
were
in
any
way
bosom
we
had
seen
a
lot
of
each
other
at
one
time
of
course
but
in
the
last
two
years
i
hadnt
had
so
much
as
a
post
card
from
him
i
put
all
this
to
jeeves
odd
his
coming
to
me
still
if
he
did
he
did
no
argument
about
that
it
must
have
been
a
nasty
jar
for
the
poor
perisher
when
he
found
i
wasnt
here
no
sir
mr
finknottle
did
not
call
to
see
you
sir
pull
yourself
together
jeeves
youve
just
told
me
that
this
is
what
he
has
been
doing
and
assiduously
at
that
it
was
i
with
whom
he
was
desirous
of
establishing
communication
sir
you
but
i
didnt
know
you
had
ever
met
him
i
had
not
had
that
pleasure
until
he
called
here
sir
but
it
appears
that
mr
sipperley
a
fellow
student
with
whom
mr
finknottle
had
been
at
the
university
recommended
him
to
place
his
affairs
in
my
hands
the
mystery
had
conked
i
saw
all
as
i
dare
say
you
know
jeevess
reputation
as
a
counsellor
has
long
been
established
among
the
cognoscenti
and
the
first
move
of
any
of
my
little
circle
on
discovering
themselves
in
any
form
of
soup
is
always
to
roll
round
and
put
the
thing
up
to
him
and
when
hes
got
a
out
of
a
bad
spot
a
puts
b
on
to
him
and
then
when
he
has
fixed
up
b
b
sends
c
along
and
so
on
if
you
get
my
drift
and
so
forth
thats
how
these
big
consulting
practices
like
jeevess
grow
old
sippy
i
knew
had
been
deeply
impressed
by
the
mans
efforts
on
his
behalf
at
the
time
when
he
was
trying
to
get
engaged
to
elizabeth
moon
so
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
should
have
advised
gussie
to
apply
pure
routine
you
might
say
oh
youre
acting
for
him
are
you
yes
sir
now
i
follow
now
i
understand
and
what
is
gussies
trouble
oddly
enough
sir
precisely
the
same
as
that
of
mr
sipperley
when
i
was
enabled
to
be
of
assistance
to
him
no
doubt
you
recall
mr
sipperleys
predicament
sir
deeply
attached
to
miss
moon
he
suffered
from
a
rooted
diffidence
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
speak
i
nodded
i
remember
yes
i
recall
the
sipperley
case
he
couldnt
bring
himself
to
the
scratch
a
marked
coldness
of
the
feet
was
there
not
i
recollect
you
saying
he
was
lettingwhat
was
itletting
something
do
something
cats
entered
into
it
if
i
am
not
mistaken
letting
i
dare
not
wait
upon
i
would
sir
thats
right
but
how
about
the
cats
like
the
poor
cat
i
the
adage
sir
exactly
it
beats
me
how
you
think
up
these
things
and
gussie
you
say
is
in
the
same
posish
yes
sir
each
time
he
endeavours
to
formulate
a
proposal
of
marriage
his
courage
fails
him
and
yet
if
he
wants
this
female
to
be
his
wife
hes
got
to
say
so
what
i
mean
only
civil
to
mention
it
precisely
sir
i
mused
well
i
suppose
this
was
inevitable
jeeves
i
wouldnt
have
thought
that
this
finknottle
would
ever
have
fallen
a
victim
to
the
divine
p
but
if
he
has
no
wonder
he
finds
the
going
sticky
yes
sir
look
at
the
life
hes
led
yes
sir
i
dont
suppose
he
has
spoken
to
a
girl
for
years
what
a
lesson
this
is
to
us
jeeves
not
to
shut
ourselves
up
in
country
houses
and
stare
into
glass
tanks
you
cant
be
the
dominant
male
if
you
do
that
sort
of
thing
in
this
life
you
can
choose
between
two
courses
you
can
either
shut
yourself
up
in
a
country
house
and
stare
into
tanks
or
you
can
be
a
dasher
with
the
sex
you
cant
do
both
no
sir
i
mused
once
more
gussie
and
i
as
i
say
had
rather
lost
touch
but
all
the
same
i
was
exercised
about
the
poor
fish
as
i
am
about
all
my
pals
close
or
distant
who
find
themselves
treading
upon
lifes
banana
skins
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
up
against
it
i
threw
my
mind
back
to
the
last
time
i
had
seen
him
about
two
years
ago
it
had
been
i
had
looked
in
at
his
place
while
on
a
motor
trip
and
he
had
put
me
right
off
my
feed
by
bringing
a
couple
of
green
things
with
legs
to
the
luncheon
table
crooning
over
them
like
a
young
mother
and
eventually
losing
one
of
them
in
the
salad
that
picture
rising
before
my
eyes
didnt
give
me
much
confidence
in
the
unfortunate
goofs
ability
to
woo
and
win
i
must
say
especially
if
the
girl
he
had
earmarked
was
one
of
these
tough
modern
thugs
all
lipstick
and
cool
hard
sardonic
eyes
as
she
probably
was
tell
me
jeeves
i
said
wishing
to
know
the
worst
what
sort
of
a
girl
is
this
girl
of
gussies
i
have
not
met
the
young
lady
sir
mr
finknottle
speaks
highly
of
her
attractions
seemed
to
like
her
did
he
yes
sir
did
he
mention
her
name
perhaps
i
know
her
she
is
a
miss
bassett
sir
miss
madeline
bassett
what
yes
sir
i
was
deeply
intrigued
egad
jeeves
fancy
that
its
a
small
world
isnt
it
what
the
young
lady
is
an
acquaintance
of
yours
sir
i
know
her
well
your
news
has
relieved
my
mind
jeeves
it
makes
the
whole
thing
begin
to
seem
far
more
like
a
practical
working
proposition
indeed
sir
absolutely
i
confess
that
until
you
supplied
this
information
i
was
feeling
profoundly
dubious
about
poor
old
gussies
chances
of
inducing
any
spinster
of
any
parish
to
join
him
in
the
saunter
down
the
aisle
you
will
agree
with
me
that
he
is
not
everybodys
money
there
may
be
something
in
what
you
say
sir
cleopatra
wouldnt
have
liked
him
possibly
not
sir
and
i
doubt
if
he
would
go
any
too
well
with
tallulah
bankhead
no
sir
but
when
you
tell
me
that
the
object
of
his
affections
is
miss
bassett
why
then
jeeves
hope
begins
to
dawn
a
bit
hes
just
the
sort
of
chap
a
girl
like
madeline
bassett
might
scoop
in
with
relish
this
bassett
i
must
explain
had
been
a
fellow
visitor
of
ours
at
cannes
and
as
she
and
angela
had
struck
up
one
of
those
effervescent
friendships
which
girls
do
strike
up
i
had
seen
quite
a
bit
of
her
indeed
in
my
moodier
moments
it
sometimes
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
not
move
a
step
without
stubbing
my
toe
on
the
woman
and
what
made
it
all
so
painful
and
distressing
was
that
the
more
we
met
the
less
did
i
seem
able
to
find
to
say
to
her
you
know
how
it
is
with
some
girls
they
seem
to
take
the
stuffing
right
out
of
you
i
mean
to
say
there
is
something
about
their
personality
that
paralyses
the
vocal
cords
and
reduces
the
contents
of
the
brain
to
cauliflower
it
was
like
that
with
this
bassett
and
me
so
much
so
that
i
have
known
occasions
when
for
minutes
at
a
stretch
bertram
wooster
might
have
been
observed
fumbling
with
the
tie
shuffling
the
feet
and
behaving
in
all
other
respects
in
her
presence
like
the
complete
dumb
brick
when
therefore
she
took
her
departure
some
two
weeks
before
we
did
you
may
readily
imagine
that
in
bertrams
opinion
it
was
not
a
day
too
soon
it
was
not
her
beauty
mark
you
that
thus
numbed
me
she
was
a
pretty
enough
girl
in
a
droopy
blonde
saucereyed
way
but
not
the
sort
of
breathtaker
that
takes
the
breath
no
what
caused
this
disintegration
in
a
usually
fairly
fluent
prattler
with
the
sex
was
her
whole
mental
attitude
i
dont
want
to
wrong
anybody
so
i
wont
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
she
actually
wrote
poetry
but
her
conversation
to
my
mind
was
of
a
nature
calculated
to
excite
the
liveliest
suspicions
well
i
mean
to
say
when
a
girl
suddenly
asks
you
out
of
a
blue
sky
if
you
dont
sometimes
feel
that
the
stars
are
gods
daisychain
you
begin
to
think
a
bit
as
regards
the
fusing
of
her
soul
and
mine
therefore
there
was
nothing
doing
but
with
gussie
the
posish
was
entirely
different
the
thing
that
had
stymied
meviz
that
this
girl
was
obviously
all
loaded
down
with
ideals
and
sentiment
and
what
notwas
quite
in
order
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
gussie
had
always
been
one
of
those
dreamy
soulful
birdsyou
cant
shut
yourself
up
in
the
country
and
live
only
for
newts
if
youre
notand
i
could
see
no
reason
why
if
he
could
somehow
be
induced
to
get
the
low
burning
words
off
his
chest
he
and
the
bassett
shouldnt
hit
it
off
like
ham
and
eggs
shes
just
the
type
for
him
i
said
i
am
most
gratified
to
hear
it
sir
and
hes
just
the
type
for
her
in
fine
a
good
thing
and
one
to
be
pushed
along
with
the
utmost
energy
strain
every
nerve
jeeves
very
good
sir
replied
the
honest
fellow
i
will
attend
to
the
matter
at
once
now
up
to
this
point
as
you
will
doubtless
agree
what
you
might
call
a
perfect
harmony
had
prevailed
friendly
gossip
between
employer
and
employed
and
everything
as
sweet
as
a
nut
but
at
this
juncture
i
regret
to
say
there
was
an
unpleasant
switch
the
atmosphere
suddenly
changed
the
storm
clouds
began
to
gather
and
before
we
knew
where
we
were
the
jarring
note
had
come
bounding
on
the
scene
i
have
known
this
to
happen
before
in
the
wooster
home
the
first
intimation
i
had
that
things
were
about
to
hot
up
was
a
pained
and
disapproving
cough
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
carpet
for
during
the
above
exchanges
i
should
explain
while
i
having
dried
the
frame
had
been
dressing
in
a
leisurely
manner
donning
here
a
sock
there
a
shoe
and
gradually
climbing
into
the
vest
the
shirt
the
tie
and
the
kneelength
jeeves
had
been
down
on
the
lower
level
unpacking
my
effects
he
now
rose
holding
a
white
object
and
at
the
sight
of
it
i
realized
that
another
of
our
domestic
crises
had
arrived
another
of
those
unfortunate
clashes
of
will
between
two
strong
men
and
that
bertram
unless
he
remembered
his
fighting
ancestors
and
stood
up
for
his
rights
was
about
to
be
put
upon
i
dont
know
if
you
were
at
cannes
this
summer
if
you
were
you
will
recall
that
anybody
with
any
pretensions
to
being
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
was
accustomed
to
attend
binges
at
the
casino
in
the
ordinary
eveningwear
trouserings
topped
to
the
north
by
a
white
messjacket
with
brass
buttons
and
ever
since
i
had
stepped
aboard
the
blue
train
at
cannes
station
i
had
been
wondering
on
and
off
how
mine
would
go
with
jeeves
in
the
matter
of
evening
costume
you
see
jeeves
is
hidebound
and
reactionary
i
had
had
trouble
with
him
before
about
softbosomed
shirts
and
while
these
messjackets
had
as
i
say
been
all
the
ragetout
ce
quil
y
a
de
chicon
the
cte
dazur
i
had
never
concealed
it
from
myself
even
when
treading
the
measure
at
the
palm
beach
casino
in
the
one
i
had
hastened
to
buy
that
there
might
be
something
of
an
upheaval
about
it
on
my
return
i
prepared
to
be
firm
yes
jeeves
i
said
and
though
my
voice
was
suave
a
close
observer
in
a
position
to
watch
my
eyes
would
have
noticed
a
steely
glint
nobody
has
a
greater
respect
for
jeevess
intellect
than
i
have
but
this
disposition
of
his
to
dictate
to
the
hand
that
fed
him
had
got
i
felt
to
be
checked
this
messjacket
was
very
near
to
my
heart
and
i
jolly
well
intended
to
fight
for
it
with
all
the
vim
of
grand
old
sieur
de
wooster
at
the
battle
of
agincourt
yes
jeeves
i
said
something
on
your
mind
jeeves
i
fear
that
you
inadvertently
left
cannes
in
the
possession
of
a
coat
belonging
to
some
other
gentleman
sir
i
switched
on
the
steely
a
bit
more
no
jeeves
i
said
in
a
level
tone
the
object
under
advisement
is
mine
i
bought
it
out
there
you
wore
it
sir
every
night
but
surely
you
are
not
proposing
to
wear
it
in
england
sir
i
saw
that
we
had
arrived
at
the
nub
yes
jeeves
but
sir
you
were
saying
jeeves
it
is
quite
unsuitable
sir
i
do
not
agree
with
you
jeeves
i
anticipate
a
great
popular
success
for
this
jacket
it
is
my
intention
to
spring
it
on
the
public
tomorrow
at
pongo
twistletons
birthday
party
where
i
confidently
expect
it
to
be
one
long
scream
from
start
to
finish
no
argument
jeeves
no
discussion
whatever
fantastic
objection
you
may
have
taken
to
it
i
wear
this
jacket
very
good
sir
he
went
on
with
his
unpacking
i
said
no
more
on
the
subject
i
had
won
the
victory
and
we
woosters
do
not
triumph
over
a
beaten
foe
presently
having
completed
my
toilet
i
bade
the
man
a
cheery
farewell
and
in
generous
mood
suggested
that
as
i
was
dining
out
why
didnt
he
take
the
evening
off
and
go
to
some
improving
picture
or
something
sort
of
olive
branch
if
you
see
what
i
mean
he
didnt
seem
to
think
much
of
it
thank
you
sir
i
will
remain
in
i
surveyed
him
narrowly
is
this
dudgeon
jeeves
no
sir
i
am
obliged
to
remain
on
the
premises
mr
finknottle
informed
me
he
would
be
calling
to
see
me
this
evening
oh
gussies
coming
is
he
well
give
him
my
love
very
good
sir
yes
sir
and
a
whisky
and
soda
and
so
forth
very
good
sir
right
ho
jeeves
i
then
set
off
for
the
drones
at
the
drones
i
ran
into
pongo
twistleton
and
he
talked
so
much
about
the
forthcoming
merrymaking
of
his
of
which
good
reports
had
already
reached
me
through
my
correspondents
that
it
was
nearing
eleven
when
i
got
home
again
and
scarcely
had
i
opened
the
door
when
i
heard
voices
in
the
sittingroom
and
scarcely
had
i
entered
the
sittingroom
when
i
found
that
these
proceeded
from
jeeves
and
what
appeared
at
first
sight
to
be
the
devil
a
closer
scrutiny
informed
me
that
it
was
gussie
finknottle
dressed
as
mephistopheles
whatho
gussie
i
said
you
couldnt
have
told
it
from
my
manner
but
i
was
feeling
more
than
a
bit
nonplussed
the
spectacle
before
me
was
enough
to
nonplus
anyone
i
mean
to
say
this
finknottle
as
i
remembered
him
was
the
sort
of
shy
shrinking
goop
who
might
have
been
expected
to
shake
like
an
aspen
if
invited
to
so
much
as
a
social
saturday
afternoon
at
the
vicarage
and
yet
here
he
was
if
one
could
credit
ones
senses
about
to
take
part
in
a
fancydress
ball
a
form
of
entertainment
notoriously
a
testing
experience
for
the
toughest
and
he
was
attending
that
fancydress
ball
mark
younot
like
every
other
wellbred
englishman
as
a
pierrot
but
as
mephistophelesthis
involving
as
i
need
scarcely
stress
not
only
scarlet
tights
but
a
pretty
frightful
false
beard
rummy
youll
admit
however
one
masks
ones
feelings
i
betrayed
no
vulgar
astonishment
but
as
i
say
whathoed
with
civil
nonchalance
he
grinned
through
the
fungusrather
sheepishly
i
thought
oh
hullo
bertie
long
time
since
i
saw
you
have
a
spot
no
thanks
i
must
be
off
in
a
minute
i
just
came
round
to
ask
jeeves
how
he
thought
i
looked
how
do
you
think
i
look
bertie
well
the
answer
to
that
of
course
was
perfectly
foul
but
we
woosters
are
men
of
tact
and
have
a
nice
sense
of
the
obligations
of
a
host
we
do
not
tell
old
friends
beneath
our
rooftree
that
they
are
an
offence
to
the
eyesight
i
evaded
the
question
i
hear
youre
in
london
i
said
carelessly
oh
yes
must
be
years
since
you
came
up
oh
yes
and
now
youre
off
for
an
evenings
pleasure
he
shuddered
a
bit
he
had
i
noticed
a
hunted
air
pleasure
arent
you
looking
forward
to
this
rout
or
revel
oh
i
suppose
itll
be
all
right
he
said
in
a
toneless
voice
anyway
i
ought
to
be
off
i
suppose
the
thing
starts
round
about
eleven
i
told
my
cab
to
wait
will
you
see
if
its
there
jeeves
very
good
sir
there
was
something
of
a
pause
after
the
door
had
closed
a
certain
constraint
i
mixed
myself
a
beaker
while
gussie
a
glutton
for
punishment
stared
at
himself
in
the
mirror
finally
i
decided
that
it
would
be
best
to
let
him
know
that
i
was
abreast
of
his
affairs
it
might
be
that
it
would
ease
his
mind
to
confide
in
a
sympathetic
man
of
experience
i
have
generally
found
with
those
under
the
influence
that
what
they
want
more
than
anything
is
the
listening
ear
well
gussie
old
leper
i
said
ive
been
hearing
all
about
you
eh
this
little
trouble
of
yours
jeeves
has
told
me
everything
he
didnt
seem
any
too
braced
its
always
difficult
to
be
sure
of
course
when
a
chap
has
dug
himself
in
behind
a
mephistopheles
beard
but
i
fancy
he
flushed
a
trifle
i
wish
jeeves
wouldnt
go
gassing
all
over
the
place
it
was
supposed
to
be
confidential
i
could
not
permit
this
tone
dishing
up
the
dirt
to
the
young
master
can
scarcely
be
described
as
gassing
all
over
the
place
i
said
with
a
touch
of
rebuke
anyway
there
it
is
i
know
all
and
i
should
like
to
begin
i
said
sinking
my
personal
opinion
that
the
female
in
question
was
a
sloppy
pest
in
my
desire
to
buck
and
encourage
by
saying
that
madeline
bassett
is
a
charming
girl
a
winner
and
just
the
sort
for
you
you
dont
know
her
certainly
i
know
her
what
beats
me
is
how
you
ever
got
in
touch
where
did
you
meet
she
was
staying
at
a
place
near
mine
in
lincolnshire
the
week
before
last
yes
but
even
so
i
didnt
know
you
called
on
the
neighbours
i
dont
i
met
her
out
for
a
walk
with
her
dog
the
dog
had
got
a
thorn
in
its
foot
and
when
she
tried
to
take
it
out
it
snapped
at
her
so
of
course
i
had
to
rally
round
you
extracted
the
thorn
yes
and
fell
in
love
at
first
sight
yes
well
dash
it
with
a
thing
like
that
to
give
you
a
sendoff
why
didnt
you
cash
in
immediately
i
hadnt
the
nerve
what
happened
we
talked
for
a
bit
what
about
oh
birds
birds
what
birds
the
birds
that
happened
to
be
hanging
round
and
the
scenery
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
she
said
she
was
going
to
london
and
asked
me
to
look
her
up
if
i
was
ever
there
and
even
after
that
you
didnt
so
much
as
press
her
hand
of
course
not
well
i
mean
it
looked
as
though
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
if
a
chap
is
such
a
rabbit
that
he
cant
get
action
when
hes
handed
the
thing
on
a
plate
his
case
would
appear
to
be
pretty
hopeless
nevertheless
i
reminded
myself
that
this
nonstarter
and
i
had
been
at
school
together
one
must
make
an
effort
for
an
old
school
friend
ah
well
i
said
we
must
see
what
can
be
done
things
may
brighten
at
any
rate
you
will
be
glad
to
learn
that
i
am
behind
you
in
this
enterprise
you
have
bertram
wooster
in
your
corner
gussie
thanks
old
man
and
jeeves
of
course
which
is
the
thing
that
really
matters
i
dont
mind
admitting
that
i
winced
he
meant
no
harm
i
suppose
but
im
bound
to
say
that
this
tactless
speech
nettled
me
not
a
little
people
are
always
nettling
me
like
that
giving
me
to
understand
i
mean
to
say
that
in
their
opinion
bertram
wooster
is
a
mere
cipher
and
that
the
only
member
of
the
household
with
brains
and
resources
is
jeeves
it
jars
on
me
and
tonight
it
jarred
on
me
more
than
usual
because
i
was
feeling
pretty
dashed
fed
with
jeeves
over
that
matter
of
the
mess
jacket
i
mean
true
i
had
forced
him
to
climb
down
quelling
him
as
described
with
the
quiet
strength
of
my
personality
but
i
was
still
a
trifle
shirty
at
his
having
brought
the
thing
up
at
all
it
seemed
to
me
that
what
jeeves
wanted
was
the
iron
hand
and
what
is
he
doing
about
it
i
inquired
stiffly
hes
been
giving
the
position
of
affairs
a
lot
of
thought
he
has
has
he
its
on
his
advice
that
im
going
to
this
dance
why
she
is
going
to
be
there
in
fact
it
was
she
who
sent
me
the
ticket
of
invitation
and
jeeves
considered
and
why
not
as
a
pierrot
i
said
taking
up
the
point
which
had
struck
me
before
why
this
break
with
a
grand
old
tradition
he
particularly
wanted
me
to
go
as
mephistopheles
i
started
he
did
did
he
he
specifically
recommended
that
definite
costume
yes
ha
eh
nothing
just
ha
and
ill
tell
you
why
i
said
ha
here
was
jeeves
making
heavy
weather
about
me
wearing
a
perfectly
ordinary
white
mess
jacket
a
garment
not
only
tout
ce
quil
y
a
de
chic
but
absolutely
de
rigueur
and
in
the
same
breath
as
you
might
say
inciting
gussie
finknottle
to
be
a
blot
on
the
london
scene
in
scarlet
tights
ironical
what
one
looks
askance
at
this
sort
of
inandout
running
what
has
he
got
against
pierrots
i
dont
think
he
objects
to
pierrots
as
pierrots
but
in
my
case
he
thought
a
pierrot
wouldnt
be
adequate
i
dont
follow
that
he
said
that
the
costume
of
pierrot
while
pleasing
to
the
eye
lacked
the
authority
of
the
mephistopheles
costume
i
still
dont
get
it
well
its
a
matter
of
psychology
he
said
there
was
a
time
when
a
remark
like
that
would
have
had
me
snookered
but
long
association
with
jeeves
has
developed
the
wooster
vocabulary
considerably
jeeves
has
always
been
a
whale
for
the
psychology
of
the
individual
and
i
now
follow
him
like
a
bloodhound
when
he
snaps
it
out
of
the
bag
oh
psychology
yes
jeeves
is
a
great
believer
in
the
moral
effect
of
clothes
he
thinks
i
might
be
emboldened
in
a
striking
costume
like
this
he
said
a
pirate
chief
would
be
just
as
good
in
fact
a
pirate
chief
was
his
first
suggestion
but
i
objected
to
the
boots
i
saw
his
point
there
is
enough
sadness
in
life
without
having
fellows
like
gussie
finknottle
going
about
in
sea
boots
and
are
you
emboldened
well
to
be
absolutely
accurate
bertie
old
man
no
a
gust
of
compassion
shook
me
after
all
though
we
had
lost
touch
a
bit
of
recent
years
this
man
and
i
had
once
thrown
inked
darts
at
each
other
gussie
i
said
take
an
old
friends
advice
and
dont
go
within
a
mile
of
this
binge
but
its
my
